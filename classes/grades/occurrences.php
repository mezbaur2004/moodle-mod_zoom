/**
 * Cumulative grading of the occurrences of recurring meetings.
 *
 * An activity graded this way has one grade item. Each occurrence is worth the grade of the
 * activity, a user's grade is the sum of what they earned in every occurrence, and the maximum
 * is the grade of the activity times the number of recorded occurrences, the same for everyone.
 *
 * Upon entry, an occurrence is the calendar event the join button was opened for, and is also
 * recorded by a scheduled task once its window opens so that a session nobody joined still counts.
 * Attendance duration, an occurrence is a cluster of meeting reports that overlap in time, so it
 * does not depend on calendar events at all.
 *
 * Scores are stored as a share of the occurrence grade, from 0 to 1. No row for a user means the
 * occurrence did not apply to them; a row with 0 means they were absent.
